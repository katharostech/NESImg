# â„¹ Sources Panel

This is the sources panel, where you add images that will be used to build metatiles, and maps.

- Each source must be an image with only 4 colors, with a height and width evenly divisible by 8 pixels.
- The sources will be split into 8x8 pixel tiles that will be used to build your metatiles.
- Source paths are relative to the NESImg project file, so if you move the project, without moving the images, you will need to update image paths with the `Change Path` button.
