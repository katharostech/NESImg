â„¹ Sources Panel
===============

This is the sources panel, where you add images that will be used to build metatiles, and maps.

Each source must be an image with only 4 colors, with a height and width evenly divisible by 8 pixels.

The sources will be split into 8x8 pixel tiles that will be used to build your metatiles.
