# â„¹ Metatiles Panel

This is the Metatiles editor. Here you take tiles from your source images and use them to make metatiles that we can make maps out of.

First off, it's important to understand what *tiles* and *metatiles* are.

- *Tile:* A tile is an 8x8 pixel square. Each tile will come from one of our source images
- *Metatile:* A metatile is a square of 4 /tiles/ to make a total of 16x16 pixels.

When building a map, you don't place tiles, you place /metatiles/.

# Creating Metatiles

The first step is to select a source image using the left sidebar.

After that you can create metatiles in two different ways:

1. Simply click and drag on the source image to select one or more 16x16 pixel squares that will be added as metatiles as soon as you release the mouse.
2. You can click the plus icon in the Metatiles sidebar. Next click a tile on your source image to select it, and click the new metatile to paint the source tile onto the metatile.

# Deleting Metatiles

You can right-click the metatiles in the sidebar to delete them.

# Next Step

After you have defined some metatiles, you can move to the Metatilesets tab to group and color your metatiles.
