# â„¹ Metatiles Panel

This is the Metatiles editor. Here you take tiles from your source images and use them to make metatiles that we can make maps out of.

First off, it's important to understand what *tiles* and *metatiles* are.

- *Tile:* A tile is an 8x8 pixel square. Each tile will come from one of our source images
- *Metatile:* A metatile is a square of 4 /tiles/ to make a total of 16x16 pixels.

When building a map, you don't place tiles, you place /metatiles/.

After you have defined some metatiles, you can move to the Namepages tab to group and color your metatiles.
